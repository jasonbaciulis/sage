## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) >= 4.7
* [PHP](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 7.1.3 (with [`php-mbstring`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) enabled)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

Recommeded VS Code extension:

## Theme installation

Clone the git repo.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jasonbaciulis/sage-thrives.git
```

Rename `sage-thrives` with the name of your theme.

Run `composer install`. This will make sure that the Composer autoload files are generated and saved to the `vendor/` directory.

## Theme setup

Edit `app/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, and sidebars.

Edit `app/filters.php` to enable or disable additional theme optimization features.

## Theme development

* Run `yarn` from the theme directory to install dependencies
* Update `resources/assets/config.json` settings:
